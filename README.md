# dihor-ha-components

Custom UI components for Home Assistant.

This repository uses a modular structure inspired by the [Mushroom Cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) project.  
The source files are written in TypeScript and live in the `src` directory.  
All components are bundled into a single JavaScript file (`dihor-ha-bundle.js`) using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), so no additional build steps are needed for users.

- `dihor-person-card` â€“ displays a personâ€™s profile picture from a `person` entity.
- `dihor-minecraft-card` â€“ displays statistics from a Minecraft server using `sensor` entities.

## ðŸ§± Usage Examples

### `dihor-hello-world-card`

```yaml
- type: custom:dihor-hello-world-card
  entity: sensor.time
```

---

### `dihor-person-card`

```yaml
- type: custom:dihor-person-card
  entity: person.your_name
```

The card displays the profile picture from the `entity_picture` attribute.

---

### `dihor-minecraft-card`

```yaml
- type: custom:dihor-minecraft-card
  title: My Minecraft Server
  entity_prefix: sensor.minecraft_server
```

This card uses multiple `sensor` entities, such as:

- `sensor.minecraft_server`
- `sensor.minecraft_server_version`
- `sensor.minecraft_server_status`
- `sensor.minecraft_server_players_online`, etc.

Make sure your Minecraft integration or MQTT sensor exposes those.
